I am passionate about leveraging data analytics and machine learning to tackle complex problems related to human health.

I have a BS and PhD in Physics / Computational Biology and completed a postdoc in structural biology. My past academic work revolved around the use of high-performance computation, simulation, and cryoEM to elucidate the assembly mechanism of bacterial membrane proteins aiding in the development of novel antibiotics. 

In my professional journey I've sought out experiences which draw upon my past scientific work and expertise while working to gain exposure to and embrace the use of modern AI/ML methods to positively impact human health. I gained a firm foundation in AI/ML by completing a Fellowship at the NYC Data Science Academy before beginning a role at Calyxt where I developed several analytic tools to help researchers identify metabolic pathways in plants and optimally deliver genetic material to maximize rare-compound production. In May 2023 I started a new position at EMD Serono in bioinformatics for translational medicine.

I am passionate about leveraging data analytics and machine learning to tackle complex problems related to human health.

I have a BS and PhD in Physics / Computational Biology and completed a postdoc in structural biology. My academic work focused on high-performance computation, simulation, and cryoEM to elucidate the assembly mechanism of bacterial membrane proteins, aiding in the development of novel antibiotics. This research resulted in publications in Nature Communications (2021) and PNAS (2018), where I identified specific protein mechanisms relevant to antimicrobial resistance.

In my professional journey, I've sought out experiences that draw upon my scientific expertise while embracing modern AI/ML methods to positively impact human health. After completing a Fellowship at the NYC Data Science Academy, I began a role at Calyxt where I developed analytic tools to help researchers identify metabolic pathways in plants and optimize rare-compound production for pharmaceutical manufacturing.

At EMD Serono (Merck group), I developed algorithms leveraging ML models and NLP data from over 30 million publications, clinical trials, and patents to improve drug target prioritization for immune disorders. I also built custom web applications for visualizing gene "trendiness" scores to enable efficient drug-target prioritization.

Currently, I work as a Scientific Consultant at Metapages (Astera Institute), where I'm helping to develop an interactive computational biology platform that enables the easy creation and sharing of interactive scientific workflows.

My technical expertise includes Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, pytorch, tensorflow, biopython, dash, plotly), R (DESeq2, Bioconductor, rshiny, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2), ML/AI methods, cloud computing, molecular docking, protein modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations.
